Hey there! My name is Perri and I am an RN who loves all things tech. I recently started learning how to code in Python. I am hoping to work as a data scientists and am absorbing all the knowledge I can get through open source in my spare time. Sometimes I feel like I am banging my head against the wall but most of the time I really love coding. It truly feels like what I was meant to do.
